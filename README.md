# Junit_Tesing

A Spring Boot project with comprehensive API testing using **JUnit** and **Spring Boot Starter Test**.

## Features

- Structured API testing to ensure reliable and robust services.
- Assertion-based validation to verify expected outcomes.
- Use of best practices for organizing tests and maintaining code quality.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Spring Boot 3.0+
- JUnit 5.x

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

## Testing Approach

1. **Spring Boot Starter Test**: This starter integrates JUnit and provides dependencies for testing Spring components.

2. **Testing APIs**: APIs are tested for the following:
   - Response status codes (e.g., `200 OK`, `400 Bad Request`).
   - Response body structure and data validation.
   - Edge cases and error handling.

3. **Assertion Functions**: Assertions are used in a logical sequence to ensure clarity:
   - `assertNotNull` to check object initialization.
   - `assertEquals` to validate data consistency.
   - `assertThrows` for exception testing.
